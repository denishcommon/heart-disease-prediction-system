The diagnosis of heart disease in most cases depends on a complex combination of clinical and pathological data. Because of this complexity, there exists a significant amount of interest among clinical professionals and researchers regarding the efficient and accurate prediction of heart disease. In this paper, we develop a heart disease prediction system that can assist medical professionals in predicting heart disease status based on clinical data of patients. Our approaches include three steps. Firstly, we select important features based on feature selection technique and according to clinical studies. Secondly, we develop artificial neural network algorithms for classifying heart disease based on these extracted clinical features. The accuracy of prediction is near 87%. Finally, we develop a user-friendly heart disease prediction system (HDPS). The HDPS system will consist of multiple features, including input clinical data section and prediction performance display section with execution time, accuracy and predicted result. Our approaches are effective in predicting the heart disease of patients. The HDPS system developed in this study is a novel approach that can be used in the classification of heart disease.
