    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The diagnosis of heart disease in most cases depends on a complex combination of clinical and pathological data.
      Because of this complexity, there exists a significant amount of interest among clinical professionals and
      researchers regarding the efficient and accurate prediction of heart disease. In this paper, we develop a heart
      disease prediction system that can assist medical professionals in predicting heart disease status based on
      clinical data of patients. Our approaches include three steps. Firstly, we select important features based on
      feature selection technique and according to clinical studies. Secondly, we develop artificial neural network
      algorithms for classifying heart disease based on these extracted clinical features. The accuracy of prediction is
      near 87%. Finally, we develop a user-friendly heart disease prediction system (HDPS). The HDPS system will consist
      of multiple features, including input clinical data section and prediction performance display section with
      execution time, accuracy and predicted result. Our approaches are effective in predicting the heart disease of
      patients. The HDPS system developed in this study is a novel approach that can be used in the classification of
      heart disease.</p>

      <h1>Dataset</h1>
      <p>The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset taken from the UCI repository.
        <br><br>
        The dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In
        particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The
        “target”
        field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer value from 0 (no presence) to 4
        (presence).
        <br><br>
        The names and personal profiles (social security number) of the patients were removed from the database in order
        to maintain privacy of the profiles.

      <h2>Attribute Information</h2>
      <p>According to clinical trials and studies only 14 factors plays a major role in detecting heart disease, which
        are:
